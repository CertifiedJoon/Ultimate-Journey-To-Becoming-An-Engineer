## Notes
### How does Internet Work?
- Network of computers, passing packets of data
- Packets of data travel in electrons
#### Bandwidth
the Maximum Transmission Capacity of a Device
#### Latency
the time it takes for a bit to travel from one place to another
#### DNS
Domain Name System, DNS servers handle matching ip address and the domain name of a website. 
One DNS servers are not capable of storing all the domains in the world. Therefore the DNS servers are connected and rely on each other for its work.
#### Data Routing
It need not follow a fixed path. Information in computers travels in packets in routes that are dterminted dynamically. Dynamically chooses the cheapest path from point A to point B. Having options for path makes packet routing makes it fault tolerant.
#### HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Standaard protocol by which webpages are transferred over the Internet. (GET request & POST request)

#### SSL & TLS
Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security are active in https: websites. HTTP requests are secured under https. Security ensured by digital certificate.
